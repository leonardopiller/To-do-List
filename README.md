# To-do-List
A To-Do list that can be displayed in Dark Mode or Light Mode, as selected by the user. User can add tasks, remove them, or mark them as done. If you need a hobby, you can find random suggestions and add them to the list.


First of all, ' X ' is inserted as a Text Node

then, this function will delete element if ' X ' is clicked. 
addCloseEventListener is called in case of those LI itens that aren't Node Elements (tasks that already comes in my HTML code).

So, the user can type his own tasks and it will appear on the To-Do list using newItem(). This function will prevent empty values to been add as a task. If value is true, it will be append to task list
